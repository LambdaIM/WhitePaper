# WhitePaper
Lambda is a fast, safe, and scalable blockchain infrastructure project, which provides decentralized applications (DAPPs) data storage capabilities
with unlimited scalability and fulfills services such as multi-chain data co-storage, cross-chain data management, data privacy protection, provable
data possession (PDP), and distributed intelligent computing through logic decoupling and independent implementation of Lambda Chain and
Lambda DB. In addition, as a blockchain infrastructure service, with the use of Sharding technology, Lambda Chain provides the capability of
processing millions of requests per second (RPS), which increases with the expansion of the system scale; with the use the sub-chain technology,
it provides future-oriented technical service capabilities with unlimited scalability.
